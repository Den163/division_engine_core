### Multiplatform renderer for the division_engine

Due to sanctions imposed on my country ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º, there are several risks associated with storing code and other resources in Microsoft services. 
I think this is an advance to find a better and reliable place.. 
So i choose GitVerse - the new github's alternative without risks of a censorship and waves of the cancel culture.  
Now this is a last commit for this platform (but not for this project). Others you can see at https://gitverse.ru/d.vision/division_engine_core
